# TaeKwonDoR
TaeKwonDoR
Summary: This is a Unity VR game made for the SWHackathon in March at ASU. As the name implies, this is a Tae Kwon Do game. The user is 
required to attach the VIVE controller to their feet. Once in the game, the user can kick targets in DoJo. The intent of this game is to 
help the user perform better kicks.
The SWHackathon started Friday at 8:00 PM and ended on Sunday 8:00 AM. I started building this project at 10:00 PM Saturday working a total 
of 10 hours. I wrote all the C# scripts and got the Dojo model online. All other models were made or modified by me.
